# Online Course App - Flutter

The platform transcends traditional learning frameworks by redefining the role of the learner beyond that of a typical student. It seamlessly integrates elements of education, the workplace, and academia, creating a holistic environment that supports both learning and meaningful interaction. Beyond just accessing educational content and attending classes online, users can engage in professional and academic discussions, building a dynamic space that fosters networking and collaboration. This approach encourages a richer, more interconnected experience, enabling participants to gain not only knowledge but also valuable insights and connections across multiple fields.

The application provides these key features:

- **Course List**: This feature enables users to browse courses organized by category.
- **Course Details**: Users can access comprehensive course information, including objectives, lessons, schedule, reviews, pricing, and more.
- **Course Tracking**: This feature allows users to view both ongoing and completed courses.
- **Chat**: Users can communicate directly with course owners or instructors in real-time.
- **Messenger**: This feature provides a separate messaging platform for users to engage in discussions, share information, or collaborate with peers.
- **Forum**: Users can participate in community forums, post questions, share insights, and discuss topics related to their courses.
- **Settings**: Users can customize account settings, including statistics, payments, notifications, privacy, security, and theme preferences.
